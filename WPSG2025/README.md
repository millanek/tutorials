# WPSG 2022 - Analyses of Introgression with SNP Data

A tutorial on analyses of introgression and the effects of introgression on species tree reconstruction 

Milan Malinsky (millanek@gmail.com) 

## Introduction

Admixture between populations and introgression between species are common. Therefore a bifurcating tree is often insufficient to capture the full evolutionary history ([example](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X16302052)). 

Patterson’s D, also known as ABBA-BABA, and the related estimate of admixture fraction <i>f</i>, referred to as the f4-ratio, are commonly used to assess evidence of gene flow between populations or closely related species in genomic datasets. They are based on examining patterns of allele sharing across populations or closely related species. Although they were developed within a population genetic framework, the methods can be successfully applied for learning about hybridisation and introgression within groups of closely related species, as long as common population genetic assumptions hold – namely that (a) the species share a substantial amount of genetic variation due to common ancestry and incomplete lineage sorting; (b) recurrent and back mutations at the same sites are negligible; and (c) substitution rates are uniform across species.

Patterson's D and related statistics have also been used to identify introgressed loci by sliding window scans along the genome, or by calculating these statistics for particular short genomic regions. Because the D statistic itself has a large variance when applied to small genomic windows and because it is a poor estimator of the amount of introgression, additional statistics which are related to the f4-ratio have been designed specifically to investigate signatures of introgression in genomic windows along chromosomes. These statistics include <i>f</i><sub>d</sub> (Martin et al., 2015), its extension <i>f</i><sub>dM</sub> (Malinsky et al., 2015), and the distance fraction <i>d</i><sub>f</sub> (Pfeifer & Kapan, 2019).

## Outline

In this tutorial, we are first going to use simulated data to demonstrate that, under gene-flow, some inferred species relationships might not correspond to any real biologial relationships. Then we are going to use [Dsuite](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13265), a software package that implements Patterson’s D and related statistics in a way that is straightforward to use and computationally efficient. This will allow us to identify admixed taxa. While exploring Dsuite, we are also going to learn or revise concepts related to application, calculation, and interpretation of the D and of related statistics. Next, we analyse a real-world Lake Tanganyika cichlid dataset to see if we reach the same conclusions as a 2016 manuscript which used a more limited dataset with fewer species. Finally, we apply sliding-window statistics to identify particular introgressed loci in a real dataset of Malawi cichlid fishes.

## Prequel: Simulating phylogenomic data with msprime
One difficulty with applying and comparing different methods in evolutionary genomics is that we rarely know what is the right answer. If methods give us conflicting answers, or any answers, how do we know if we can trust them? One approach that is often helpful is the use of simulated data. Knowing the truth allows us to see if the methods we are using make sense. 

One of the fastest software packages around for simulating phylogenomic data is the coalescent-based [msprime](https://msprime.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) ([manuscript](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004842)). The msprime manuscript and the software itself are presented in a population genetic framework. However, we can also use msprime to produce phylogenomic data. This is because, from the point of view of looking purely at genetic data, there is no fundamental distinction between a set of allopatric populations of a single species and a set of different species. The genealogical processes that play out across different populations are indeed the same as the processes that determine the genetic relationships along-the-genome of any species that may arise. This idea of a continuum between population genetics and multi-species analyses is one of the central themes of this workshop.

For this exercise, we have simulated SNP data for 20 species in the VCF format, two individuals from each species. The species started diverging 1 million generations ago, with effective population sizes on each branch set to 50,000. Both the recombination and mutation rates were set to 1 \* 10<sup>-8</sup> and 20 Mb of data were simulated. 

There are two datasets. First a simulation without gene-flow ([VCF](data/chr1_no_geneflow.vcf.gz), true tree: [image](img/simulated_tree_no_geneflow.pdf), [newick](data/simulated_tree_no_geneflow.nwk), [json](data/simulated_tree_no_geneflow.nwk.mass_migrations.json)), and second, a simulation where five gene-flow events have been added to a tree ([VCF](data/with_geneflow.vcf.gz), true tree with gene-flow: [image](img/simulated_tree_with_geneflow.pdf), [newick](data/simulated_tree_with_geneflow.nwk), [json](data/simulated_tree_with_geneflow.nwk.mass_migrations.json)).      


The theory and practice of simulating population genomic data will be covered in detail next week on Thursday by Georgia Tsambos.

  It is in principle possible to simulate data from an arbitrary phylogeny with msprime, but specifying the phylogenetic tree directly in the program is complicated. Therefore, a number of 'helper' wrapper programs have been developed that can make this task much easier for us. For this exercise, we use Hannes Svardal's [pypopgen3](https://github.com/feilchenfeldt/pypopgen3). After installing pypogen3 and its dependencies, using the instructions on the webpage, we simulated the data using the following code:
  
  ```python3
  from pypopgen3.modules import treetools
  from pypopgen3.modules import simulate
  
  # generating a 'random' tree with 20 species, 2 diploid individuals per species, and no gene-flow events:
  t = treetools.get_random_geneflow_species_tree(n_species=20,n_geneflow_events=0,sample_sizes=4,random_tree_process='ete3')
  # preparing the msprime command input:
  (samples, population_configurations, sorted_events, sample_to_pop, sample_names, id_to_name) = simulate.msprime_input_from_split_tree(t)
  # running the simulation - this takes about 2 hours
  tree_sequence = simulate.simulate_to_vcf("self_chr1_no_geneflow.vcf.gz", samples, population_configurations, sorted_events, 1e-8, 1e-8, 20000000, sample_names=sample_names, chrom_id="chr1")
  # write out the tree:
  t.write(format=1, outfile="self_simulated_tree_no_geneflow.nwk")
  
  # generating a 'random' tree with 20 species, 2 diploid individuals per species, and five randomly placed gene-flow events:
  t_gf = treetools.get_random_geneflow_species_tree(n_species=20,n_geneflow_events=5,sample_sizes=4,random_tree_process='ete3')
  # preparing the msprime command input:
  (samples, population_configurations, sorted_events, sample_to_pop, sample_names, id_to_name) = simulate.msprime_input_from_split_tree(t_gf)
  # running the simulation - this takes about 2 hours
  tree_sequence = simulate.simulate_to_vcf("self_chr1_with_geneflow.vcf.gz", samples, population_configurations, sorted_events, 1e-8, 1e-8, 20000000, sample_names=sample_names, chrom_id="chr1")
  # write out the tree:
  t_gf.write(format=1, outfile="self_simulated_tree_with_geneflow.nwk")
  ```
  
  Note that if you run this code yourselves, the data and the trees that you get out will be somewhat different from the ones we prepared for you, because the trees are randomly generated and the coalescent simulation run by msprime is also a stochastic process. Therefore, every simulation will be different. If you want to simulate more data using the trees we provided to you, you would replace the  ```treetools.get_random_geneflow_species_tree```  commands with the following code to read the provided trees:


 ```python3
    # reads the newick tree without gene-flow (the empty json file also needs to be in the folder) 
    t = treetools.HsTree("simulated_tree_no_geneflow.nwk")
  
    # reads the newick tree and json file with gene-flow evens
    t_gf = treetools.HsTree("simulated_tree_with_geneflow.nwk")
```

## 1. Reconstructing phylogenies from simulated data

We start by applying a couple of simple phylogentic (or phylogenomic) approaches to see if we can recover the trees that were used as input to the simulations. We are going to use algorithms implemented in [PAUP\*](http://phylosolutions.com/paup-test/). 

Our msprime simulation did not use any specific [substitution model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_DNA_evolution) for mutations, but simply designated alleles as `0` for ancestral and `1` for derived. The alleles are indicated in the fourth (REF) and fifth (ALT) column of the VCF as per the [VCF file format](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf). To use PAUP\* we first need to convert the the VCF into the Nexus format, and this needs the  `0` and `1` alleles to be replaced by actual DNA bases. We can use the [vcf2phylip.py](src/vcf2phylip.py) python script and achieve these steps as follows, first for the dataset simulated without gene-flow:

```bash
# unzip the VCF and process it with AWK to replace each ancestral allele (fourth column) with an A and each derived allele (fifth column) with a T
gunzip -c chr1_no_geneflow.vcf.gz | awk 'BEGIN{OFS=FS="\t"}{ if(NR > 6) { $4="A"; $5="T"; print $0} else {print}};' | gzip -c > chr1_no_geneflow_nt.vcf.gz
# convert the VCF to the Nexus format:
vcf2phylip.py -i chr1_no_geneflow_nt.vcf.gz -p --nexus
```

Next, we start the command line version of PAUP\* to construct a Neighbour-Joining tree. To start PAUP\*, simply type `paup` on the command line. Then follow the commands below.
  
```bash
# Load the data file in the nexus format:
execute chr1_no_geneflow_nt.min4.nexus
# See the "Taxon-status summary":
tstatus
# Assign the correct outgroup:
Outgroup outgroup.0
# Reconstruct the Neighbour-Joining tree:
set criterion = distance;
nj brlens = yes treefile=njtree_noGeneFlow.tre;
```

The resulting tree is saved to `~/workshop_materials/a08_d_statistics/njtree_noGeneFlow.tre` on the virtual machine. Press `q` followed by the `Enter/return` key to quit PAUP\*. Then, to copy the tree file to your computer (where you can view it in FigTree), you can use scp as follows:

```bash
scp wpsg@ec2-XX-XXX-XXX-XXX.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/workshop_materials/a08_d_statistics/njtree_noGeneFlow.tre . 
```

Alternatively, you can visualise the tree by using Figtree on your instance via Guacamole.

As you can see by comparison against [the input tree](img/simulated_tree_no_geneflow.pdf), a simple Neigbour Joining (NJ) algorithm easily reconstructed the tree topology perfectly. Even the branch lengths are almost perfect. 

<details>
<summary>Click here to see the reconstructed NJ tree without gene-flow</summary>

<p align="center"><img src="img/chr1_no_geneflow_bases.min4_NJ.jpg" alt="PAUP\*" width="600"></p>

</details>

Now we repeat the same tree-reconstruction procedure for the simulation with gene-flow, starting with file format conversion: 

```bash
# unzip the VCF and process it with AWK to replace each ancestral allele (fourth column) with an A and each derived allele (fifth column) with a T
gunzip -c with_geneflow.vcf.gz | awk 'BEGIN{OFS=FS="\t"}{ if(NR > 27) { $4="A"; $5="T"; print $0} else {print}};' | gzip -c > with_geneflow_nt.vcf.gz
# convert the VCF to the Nexus format:
vcf2phylip.py -i with_geneflow_nt.vcf.gz -p --nexus
```

Then load the file `with_geneflow_nt.min4.nexus` into PAUP\*, designate the outgroup, and run the Neighbor Joining tree reconstruction.
 
```bash
# Load the data file in the nexus format:
execute with_geneflow_nt.min4.nexus
# See the "Taxon-status summary":
tstatus
# Assign the correct outgroup:
Outgroup outgroup.0
# Reconstruct the Neighbour-Joining tree:
set criterion = distance;
nj brlens = yes treefile=njtree_withGeneFlow.tre;
``` 

You should get a tree like the one below:

<p align="center"><img src="img/with_geneflow_bases.min4_NJ.jpg" alt="PAUP\*" width="600"></p>

An examination of this reconstructed tree reveals that in this case we did not recover the topology of the [true tree](img/simulated_tree_with_geneflow.pdf) used as input to the simulation. Unlike in the true tree, in the reconstructed tree species  `S14` is  no longer included in the clade formed by  `S13,S15,S16`. This is most likely because of the gene-flow that `S14` received from `S00`. This is a typical pattern: when one species from within a group receives introgression from another group, it tends to be "pulled out" like this in phylogenetic reconstruction. One argument that could be made here is that the Neighbor Joining algorithm is not appropriate for this purpose, and that perhaps newer, more sophisticated, methods would recover the correct tree. You can now try to apply SVDQuartets in PAUP\*, and also try any of the other phylogenomic methods you may know to see if any of these will succeed.

<details>
<summary>Click here to see the reconstructed SVDQuartets tree with gene-flow</summary>

As you can see, the topology is in fact different from the Neighbor Joining, but also is not correct (`S13,S14` should not be sister taxa, also `S10` and `S11` are swapped) . 

<p align="center"><img src="img/with_geneflow_bases.min4_SVDQ.jpg" alt="PAUP\*" width="600"></p>

</details>

```bash
# Assign the correct outgroup:
Outgroup outgroup.0
# PAUP\* SVD quartets command
svdq taxpartition=none showScores=no seed=1234568;
# And save the tree to a file:
savetrees file=SVDq_withGeneFlow.tre
```

Finally, it is important to note that the above reconstructed trees are not really species trees, because they have multiple individuals per species. A real species-tree reconstruction approach would integrate data from both individuals for each species. The SVDquartets approach implemented in PAUP\* is capable of this, when we specify which individuals belong to which species. This is done using the file 'taxpartitions_simulated.nex' as shown below.

```bash
# Define 'taxpratitions' - i.e. partitions of individuals into taxa (which individuals belong to which species)
execute taxpartitions_simulated.nex 
# Assign the correct outgroup:
Outgroup simulatedspecies.OG
# PAUP\* SVD quartets command
svdq taxpartition=simulatedspecies showScores=no seed=1234568;
# And save the tree to a file:
savetrees file=SVDq_withGeneFlow_SpeciesTree.tre
```

A more comprehensive tutorial on species tree reconstruction is prepared for tomorrow afternoon by Micheal Matschiner and the Workshop Team.

## 2. Testing for gene-flow in simulated data 

Under incomplete lineage sorting alone, two sister species are expected to share about the same proportion of derived alleles with a third closely related species. Thus, if species "P1" and "P2" are sisters and "P3" is a closely related species, then the number of derived alleles shared by P1 and P3 but not P2 and the number of derived alleles that is shared by P2 and P3 but not P1 should be approximately similar. In contrast, if hybridization leads to introgression between species P3 and one out the two species P1 and P2, then P3 should share more derived alleles with that species than it does with the other one, leading to asymmetry in the sharing of derived alleles. These expectations are the basis for the so-called "ABBA-BABA test" (first described in the Supporting Material of [Green et al. 2010](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/710.full)) that quantifies support for introgression by the *D*-statistic. Below is an illustration of the basic principle. 

<p align="center"><img src="img/DstatIllustration2.png" alt="Dstat\*" width="600"></p>

In short, if there is gene-flow between P2 &lt;-&gt; P3, there is going to be an excess of the ABBA pattern, leading to positive D statistics. In contrast, gene-flow between P1 &lt;-&gt; P3 would lead to a an excess of the BABA pattern and a negative D statistic. However, whether a species is assigned in the P1 or P2 position is arbitrary, so we can always assign them so that P2 and P3 share more derived alleles and the D statistic is then bounded between 0 and 1. There is also a related and somewhat more complicated measure,  the f4-ratio, which strives to estimate the admixture proportion in percentage. We will not go into the maths here - if you are interested, have a look at the [Dsuite paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13265). 

To calculate D and related statistics, we are going to use the [Dsuite](https://github.com/millanek/Dsuite) program (described in detail in the paper linked above). The Dsuite software has several advantages: it brings several related statistics together into one software package, has a straightforward workflow to calculate the D statistics and the f4-ratio for all combinations of trios in the dataset, and the standard VCF as input format, thus generally avoiding the need for format conversions or data duplication. It is computationally more efficient than other software in the core tasks, making it more practical for analysing large genome-wide data sets with tens or even hundreds of populations or species. Finally, Dsuite implements the calculation of the <i>f</i><sub>dM</sub> and <i>f</i>-branch statistics for the first time in publicly available software.

To calculate the D statistics and the f4-ratio for all combinations of trios of species, all we need is the file that specifies what individuals belong to which population/species - we prepared it for you: [species_sets.txt](data/species_sets.txt). Such a file could be simply prepared manually, but, in this case we can save ourselves the work and automate the process using a combination of `bcftools` and `awk`:   

```bash
bcftools query -l chr1_no_geneflow.vcf.gz | awk '{ if (NR <= 40) {sp=substr($1,1,3); print $1"\t"sp} else {print $1"\tOutgroup";}}' > species_sets.txt
```
Something similar to the above can be useful in many cases, depending on how the individuals are named in your VCF file. 

* Then, to familiarize yourself with Dsuite, simply start the program with the command `Dsuite`. When you hit enter, you should see a help text that informs you about three different commands named "Dtrios", "DtriosCombine", and "Dinvestigate", with short descriptions of what these commands do. Of the three commands, we are going to focus on Dtrios, which is the one that calculates the *D*-statistic for all possible species trios.

* To learn more about the command, type `Dsuite Dtrios` and hit enter. The help text should then inform you about how to run this command. There are numerous options, but the defaults are approprite for a vast majority of use-cases.  All we are going to do is to provide a run name using the `-n` option, the correct tree using the `-t` option, and use the `-c` option to indicate that this is the entire dataset and, therefore, we don't need intermediate files for "DtriosCombine". 

<a name="TestingWithoutGeneflow"></a>
### 2.1 Do we find geneflow in data simulated without geneflow?

We run Dsuite for the dataset without gene-flow as follows:

```bash
Dsuite Dtrios -c -n no_geneflow -t simulated_tree_no_geneflow.nwk chr1_no_geneflow.vcf.gz species_sets.txt 
```
The run takes about 50 minutes. Therefore, we already put the output files for you in the `~/workshop_materials/a08_d_statistics/precomputed_results` folder on the instance.  Let's have a look at the first few lines of  [`species_sets_no_geneflow_BBAA.txt`](data/species_sets_no_geneflow_BBAA.txt):

```bash

```

Each row shows the results for the analysis of one trio. For example in the first row, species *S01* was used as P1, *S02* was considered as P2, and *S00* was placed in the position of P3. Then we see the D statistic, associated Zscore and p-value, the f4-ratio estimating admixture proportion and then the counts of BBAA sites (where  `S01` and  `S02` share the derived allele) and then the counts of ABBA and BABA sites. As you can see, ABBA is always more than BABA and the D statistic is always positive because Dsuite orients P1 and P2 in this way. Since these results are for coalescent simulations without gene-flow, the ABBA and BABA patterns arise purely through incomplete lineage sorting and the difference between them is purely stochastic - therefore, even though the D statistic can be quite high (e.g. up to 8% on the last line), this is not a result of gene flow. 

**Question 1:** Can you tell why the BBAA, ABBA, and BABA numbers are not integer numbers but have decimal positions? 
<details>
<summary>Click here to see the answer</summary>

Integer counts of ABBA and BABA sites would only be expected if each species would be represented only by a single haploid sequence. With diploid sequences and multiple samples per species, allele frequences are taken into account to weigh the counts of ABBA and BABA sites as described by equations 1a to 1c of the [Dsuite paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13265).
</details>

**Question 2:** How many different trios are listed in the file? Are these all possible (unordered) trios? 
<details>
<summary>Click here to see the answer</summary>


Because each trio is listed on a single row, the number of trios in file [`species_sets_no_geneflow_BBAA.txt`](data/species_sets_no_geneflow_BBAA.txt) is identical to the number of lines in this file. This number can easily be counted using, e.g. the following command:

    cat species_sets_no_geneflow_BBAA.txt | wc -l
    
You should see that the file includes 1140 lines and therefore results for 1140 trios. Given that the dataset includes (except the outgroup species) 20 species and 3 of these are required to form a trio, the number of possible trios is 

[20 choose 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) = 20! / (3! &times; 17!) = 1140.

(where ! denotes the [factorial function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial))

</details>

In [`species_sets_no_geneflow_BBAA.txt`](data/species_sets_no_geneflow_BBAA.txt), trios are arranged so that P1 and P2 always share the most derived alleles (BBAA is always the highest number). There are two other output files: one with the `_tree.txt` suffix: [`species_sets_no_geneflow_tree.txt`](data/species_sets_no_geneflow_tree.txt) where trios are arranged according to the tree we gave Dsuite, and a file with the `_Dmin.txt` suffix [`species_sets_no_geneflow_Dmin.txt`](data/species_sets_no_geneflow_Dmin.txt) where trios are arranged so that the D statistic is minimised - providing a kind of "lower bound" on gene-flow statistics. This can be useful in cases where the true relationships between species are not clear, as illustrated for example in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0717-x) (Fig. 2a). 

Let's first see how the other outputs differ from the  `_tree.txt` file, which has the correct trio arrangments. :

```bash

There is one difference in the `_BBAA.txt` file. Because of incomplete lineage sorting being a stochastic (random) process, we see that  `S08` and  `S10` share more derived alleles than `S09` and  `S10`, which are sister species in the input tree. If you look again at the input tree, you will see that  the branching order between `S08`,  `S09` and  `S10` is very rapid, it is almost a polytomy.

A comparison of the `_tree.txt` file against the `_Dmin.txt`, which minimises the Dstatistic, reveals nine differences. However, the correct trio arrangements in all these cases are very clear.

```bash
diff species_sets_no_geneflow_Dmin.txt species_sets_no_geneflow_tree.txt
```

Next, let's look at the results in more detail, for example in [R](https://www.r-project.org). We load the `_BBAA.txt` file and first look at the distribution of D values:  

```R
setwd("/home/wpsg/workshop_materials/a08_d_statistics/precomputed_results")
D_BBAA_noGF <- read.table("species_sets_no_geneflow_BBAA.txt",as.is=T,header=T)
plot(D_BBAA_noGF$Dstatistic, ylab="D",xlab="trio number")
```

<p align="center"><img src="img/no_geneflow_Dvals.png" alt="DstatNoGF\*" width="600"></p>

There are some very high D statistics. In fact, the D statistics for 9 trios are &gt;0.7, which is extremely high. So how is this possible in a dataset simulated with no geneflow? 

```R
D_BBAA_noGF[which(D_BBAA_noGF$Dstatistic > 0.7),]
     P1  P2  P3 Dstatistic      Z.score    p.value    f4.ratio   BBAA ABBA BABA

```
These nine cases arise because there is amost no incomplete lineage sorting among these trios almost all sites are `BBAA` - e.g. 179922 sites for the first trio, while the count for `ABBA` is only 1.5 and for `BABA` it is 0 . The D statistic is calculated as D = (ABBA-BABA)/(ABBA+BABA), which for the first trio would be D = (1.5-0)/(1.5+0)=1. So, the lesson here is that the D statistic is very sensitive to random fluctuations when there is a small number of ABBA and BABA sites. One certainly cannot take the D value seriously unless it is supported by a statistical test suggesting that the D is significanly different from 0. In the most extreme cases above, the p-value could not even be calculated, because there were so few sites. Those definitely do not represent geneflow. But in one case we see a p value of 0.00353794. Well, that looks significant, if one considers the traditional 0.05 cutoff. So, again, how is this possible in a dataset simulated with no geneflow? You can use the following R command to plot the distribution of p-values.

```R
plot(D_BBAA_noGF$p.value, ylab="p value",xlab="trio number",ylim=c(0,0.05))
```
<p align="center"><img src="img/no_geneflow_Pvals.png" alt="DstatNoGF-Pvals\*" width="600"></p>

In fact, there are many p values that are &lt;0.05. For those who have a good understanding of statistics this will be not be suprising. This is because [p values are uniformly distributed](https://neuroneurotic.net/2018/10/29/p-values-are-uniformly-distributed-when-the-null-hypothesis-is-true/) when the null hypopthesis is true. Therefore, we expect 5% (or 1 in 20) of the p-values to be &lt;0.05. If we did a 1140 tests, we can expect 57 of them to be &lt;0.05. Therefore, any time we conduct a large amount of statistical tests, we should apply a multiple testing correction - commonly used is the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction which controls for the [false discovery rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate).

```R
plot(p.adjust(D_BBAA_noGF$p.value,method="BH"), ylab="p value",xlab="trio number",ylim=c(0,0.05))
```
<p align="center"><img src="img/no_geneflow_correctedPvals.png" alt="DstatNoGF-PvalsCorrected\*" width="600"></p>

However, even after applying the BH correction there are three p-values which look significant. These are all false discoveries. Here comes an important scientific lesson - that even if we apply statistical tests correctly, seeing a p-value below 0.05 is not a proof that the null hypothesis is false. All hypothesis testing has [false positives and false negatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors). It may be helpful to focus less on statistical testing and aim for a more nuanced understanding of the dataset, as argued for example in this [Nature commentary](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9). 

Therefore, we should also plot the f4-ratio, which estimates the proportion of genome affected by geneflow. It turns out that this is perhaps the most reliable - all the f4-ratio values are tiny, as they should be for a dataset without geneflow.  

```R
plot(D_BBAA_noGF$f4.ratio, ylab="f4-ratio",xlab="trio number", ylim=c(0,1))
```
<p align="center"><img src="img/no_geneflow_f4-ratios.png" alt="DstatF4ratio\*" width="600"></p>

Finally, we visualise the data with a heatmap in which the species in positions P2 and P3 are sorted on the horizontal and vertical axes, and the color of the corresponding heatmap cell indicates the most significant *D*-statistic found between these two species, across all possible species in P1. To prepare this plot, we need to prepare a file that lists the order in which the P2 and P3 species should be plotted along the heatmap axes. The file should look like  [`plot_order.txt`](data/plot_order.txt). You could prepare this file manually, or below is a programmatic way: 

```bash
cut -f 2 species_sets.txt | uniq | head -n 20 > precomputed_results/plot_order.txt
```

Then make the plots using the scripts [`plot_d.rb`](src/plot_d.rb) and [`plot_f4ratio.rb`](src/plot_f4ratio.rb). 

```bash
cd precomputed_results
plot_d.rb species_sets_no_geneflow_BBAA.txt plot_order.txt 0.7 species_sets_no_geneflow_BBAA_D.svg
plot_f4ratio.rb species_sets_no_geneflow_BBAA.txt plot_order.txt 0.2 species_sets_no_geneflow_BBAA_f4ratio.svg
```

<a name="TestingWithGeneflow"></a>
#### 2.2 Do we find geneflow in data simulated with geneflow?

We start by loking at the simplest case with an outgroup and three species and one gene-flow event. We subset the 20-species tree to focus only of species S9, S10, and S11. You can see the relevant subset of the tree below:

<p align="center"><img src="img/simulated_gfTree_9_10_11.png" alt="simulated_gfTree" width="600"></p>

You can run this analysis using the command below (this should be done within one or two minutes):
 
```bash
Dsuite Dtrios with_geneflow_9_10_11.vcf.gz species_sets_9_10_11.txt
```

Checking the results in the output file `species_sets_9_10_11_BBAA.txt`, we see `D=0.805219` and p-value of  2 \* 10<sup>-16</sup>. Also the f4-ratio statistic is highly elevated at `f4-ratio=0.095`. We can conclude that these values are substantially more convincing than anything we saw in the no-gene-flow case. We have detected the gene-flow event. We can also see that the f4-ratio estimate is lower than the true gene-flow fraction (9.5\% vs. 16\%). 


However, we often have more than three species to consider. How do the overall, 20 species results for the simulation with geneflow differ from the above non-gene-flow case? Here we are going to run a similar set of analyses and make comparisons. We run Dsuite for the entire dataset with gene-flow as follows:

```bash
Dsuite Dtrios -c -n with_geneflow -t simulated_tree_with_geneflow.nwk with_geneflow.vcf.gz species_sets.txt 
```

Again, this takes about 50 minutes, so the output files  [`species_sets_with_geneflow_BBAA.txt`](data/species_sets_with_geneflow_BBAA.txt),  [`species_sets_with_geneflow_tree.txt`](data/species_sets_with_geneflow_tree.txt) and [`species_sets_with_geneflow_Dmin.txt`](data/species_sets_with_geneflow_Dmin.txt) are already provided.

Now we find 39 differences between the  `_tree.txt` file and the `_BBAA.txt`, reflecting that, under geneflow, sister species often do not share the most derived alleles. Between  `_tree.txt` file and the `_Dmin.txt` there are 124 differences.

```bash
diff species_sets_with_geneflow_BBAA.txt species_sets_with_geneflow_tree.txt | grep -c '<'
diff species_sets_with_geneflow_Dmin.txt species_sets_with_geneflow_tree.txt | grep -c '<'
```

We can visualise the overlap between these different files using a Venn diagram. For example in R:

```R
library("VennDiagram")
D_BBAA <- read.table("species_sets_with_geneflow_BBAA.txt",as.is=T,header=T)
D_Dmin <- read.table("species_sets_with_geneflow_Dmin.txt",as.is=T,header=T)
D_tree <- read.table("species_sets_with_geneflow_tree.txt",as.is=T,header=T)

D_BBAA$P123 <- paste(D_BBAA$P1,D_BBAA$P2,D_BBAA$P3,sep="_"); D_Dmin$P123 <- paste(D_Dmin$P1, D_Dmin$P2, D_Dmin$P3,sep="_"); D_tree$P123 <- paste(D_tree$P1, D_tree$P2, D_tree$P3,sep="_")

draw.triple.venn(length(D_BBAA$P123),length(D_Dmin$P123),length(D_tree$P123),length(which(D_BBAA$P123 == D_Dmin$P123)),length(which(D_tree$P123 == D_Dmin$P123)),length(which(D_tree$P123 == D_BBAA$P123)),length(which(D_tree$P123 == D_BBAA$P123 & D_Dmin$P123 == D_BBAA$P123 & D_Dmin$P123 == D_tree$P123)),category = c("BBAA", "Dmin", "tree"), lty = "blank", fill = c("skyblue", "pink1", "darkolivegreen1"))
```

<p align="center"><img src="img/trippleVenn.png" alt="trippleVenn\*" width="600"></p>

Then we explore the results in the `_BBAA.txt` in R, analogously to how we did it above for the no-geneflow case:

```R
plot(D_BBAA$Dstatistic, ylab="D",xlab="trio number") # The D statistic
plot(p.adjust(D_BBAA$p.value,method="BH"), ylab="corected p value",xlab="trio number",ylim=c(0,0.05))
plot(D_BBAA$f4.ratio, ylab="f4-ratio",xlab="trio number", ylim=c(0,0.2))
```

</details>

<p>
<img align="left" src="img/simulated_tree_with_geneflow.png" width="200"> 

As you can see if you click above, the distributions of the statistics are markedly different when compared against the no-geneflow scenario. The number of D statistics &gt;0.7 here is 85 (compared with 9 under no-geneflow) and very many trios now have significant p values - even after FDR correction, we have p&lt;0.05 for whopping 671 trios. Finally, the f4-ratios are also elevated, up to almost 15% in some cases.  

To remind ourselves, the simulated tree and geneflow events are shown on the left. The 15% f4-ratios estimates correspond reasonably well with the strength of the geneflow events that we simulated (in the region of 8% to 18%). However, we simulated only five geneflow events and have 671 significant p values and 138 f4-ratio values above 3%. This is because the test statistics are correlated when trios share an (internal) branch in the overall population or species tree. Therefore, a system of all possible four taxon tests across a data set can be difficult to interpret. In any case (and with any methods) pinpointing specific introgression events in data sets with tens or hundreds of populations or species remains challenging - especially when genetic data is all the evidence we have.  

The scripts [`plot_d.rb`](src/plot_d.rb) and [`plot_f4ratio.rb`](src/plot_f4ratio.rb) were originally developed to help with such interpretation, and can still be useful. Because they take the maximum D or f4-ratio value between species in the P2 and P3 positions, across all possible species in P1, the plot deals with some of the correlated signals and redundancy in the data by focusing on the overall support for geneflow between pairs of species or their ancestors, which could have happened at any time in the past since the species in P2 and P3 positions diverged from each other.

```

<p align="center"><img src="img/species_sets_with_geneflow_BBAA_Dandf4ratio.png" alt="Dvals\*" width="600"></p>

**Question 3:** How informative are the plots above? Can you identify the gene flow events from the plots? 

As an upgrade on the above plots we developed with Hannes Svardal, the f-branch or fb(C) metric (introduced in [Malinsky et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0717-x). This is designed to disentangle correlated f4-ratio results and, unlike the matrix presentation above, f-branch can assign gene flow to specific, possibly internal, branches on a phylogeny. The f-branch metric builds upon and formalises verbal arguments employed by [Martin et al. (2013)](http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.159426.113), who used these lines of reasoning to assign gene flow to specific internal branches on the phylogeny of Heliconius butterflies. 

The logic of f-branch is illustated in the following figure. The panel (c) provides an example illustrating interdependences between different f4-ratio scores, which can be informative about the timing of introgression. In this example, different choices for the P1 population provide constraints on when the gene flow could have happened. (d) Based on relationships between the f4-ratio results from different four taxon tests, the f-branch, or f<sub>b</sub> statistic, distinguishes between admixture at different time periods, assigning signals to different (possibly internal) branches in the population/species tree

<p align="center"><img src="img/FbranchIllustation.png" alt="\*" width="600"></p>

This is implemented in the `Dsuite Fbranch` subcommand, and the plotting utility, called `dtools.py` is in the utils subfolder of the Dsuite package.

```bash
Dsuite Fbranch simulated_tree_with_geneflow.nwk species_sets_with_geneflow_tree.txt > species_sets_with_geneflow_Fbranch.txt
dtools.py species_sets_with_geneflow_Fbranch.txt simulated_tree_with_geneflow.nwk
```

The second command creates a file called `fbranch.png`, which is shown below.

<p align="center"><img src="img/fbranch.png" alt="\*" width="600"></p>

**Question 4:** Can you identify the gene flow events clearer here than from the matrix plots above? Is this a good showcase for the f-branch method?  

**Question 5:** If you exclude species with the strongest f4-ratio of f-branch signals, can you then get a correct phylogeny from PAUP\*?

**Question 6:** What happens when you re-run Dsuite with the inferred (wrong) tree from PAUP\*?

## 3. Finding geneflow in a real dataset - Tanganyikan cichlids

In this exercise, we are going to see if we can reproduce the findings reported by [Gante et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13767), with a different dataset. The Gante et al. dataset contained whole genome sequence data from five species from the cichlid genus Neolamprologus. The authors analysed these data and reported conclusions that are summarised by the figure below:

<p align="center"><img src="img/gante.png"></p>

Here we use data with 10 Neolamprologus species (the clearly hybrid Neolamprologus cancellatus removed), to reassess the evidence for geneflow within this genus with the f4-ratio and f-branch statistics. The genetic data are in [`NC_031969.vcf.gz`](data/TanganyikaCichlids/NC_031969.vcf.gz). Start by reconstructing a species tree with PAUP\*, in the same way as you did for the simulated data above. 

**Question 7:** Are the trees you reconstructed in these exercises consistent with the relationships reported by Gante et al.?


Next, we are going to assess the evidence for introgression. The file specifying sample->species relationships is [`NC_031969_sets.txt`](data/TanganyikaCichlids/NC_031969_sets.txt) and one possible tree topology hypothesis is in [`SNAPP_tree.txt`](data/TanganyikaCichlids/SNAPP_tree.txt). To use the trees We run the analysis for all possible trios as follows:

```bash
Dsuite Dtrios -c -t SNAPP_tree.txt NC_031969.vcf.gz NC_031969_sets.txt
```

This should finish in a couple of minutes. There are 'only' ten species, so 120 trios. Could this be manageable? Have a look at the output file [NC_031969_sets_tree.txt](data/TanganyikaCichlids/NC_031969_sets__tree.txt) and see if you can interpret the results. Chances are that is is still too complex to interpret the results for the trios just by looking at them. Perhaps you can try the ‘f-branch’ method:

```bash
Dsuite Fbranch SNAPP_tree.txt NC_031969_sets_tree.txt > Tanganyika_Fbranch.txt
dtools.py Tanganyika_Fbranch.txt SNAPP_tree.txt
```

<p align="center"><img src="data/TanganyikaCichlids/fbranch.png"></p>

**Question 8:** Are the geneflow signals seen here consistent with the Gante et al. figure?

**Question 9:** What happens when we focus only on the five species from Gante et al. and exclude all other species?

## 4. Finding specific introgressed loci - adaptive introgression in Malawi cichlids

This exercise is based on analysis from the [Malinsky et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0717-x) manuscript published in Nature Ecol. Evo.. The paper shows that two deep water adapted lineages of cichlids share signatures of selection and very similar haplotypes in two green-sensitive opsin genes (RH2Aβ and RH2B). The genes are located next to each other on scaffold_18. To find out whether these shared signatures are the result of convergent evolution or of adaptive introgression, we used the f_dM statistic. The f_dM is related to Patterson’s D and to the f4-ratio, but is better suited to analyses of sliding genomic windows. The calculation of this statistic is implemented in the program `Dsuite Dinvestigate`.

The data for this exercise are on the instances in the `~/workshop_materials/a08_d_statistics/Dinvestigate_Malawi` folder. It includes the VCF file with variants mapping to the scaffold_18 of the Malawi cichlid reference genome we used at the time - [`scaffold_18.vcf.gz`](data/scaffold_18.vcf.gz). There are also two other files required to run Dinvestigate: the “SETS” file and the “test_trios” file. In this case they are called: [`MalawiSetsFile.txt`](data/MalawiSetsFile.txt) and [`MalawiTestTriosForInvestigate.txt`](data/MalawiTestTriosForInvestigate.txt). The “TestTrios” file specifies that we want to investigate the admixture signal between the Diplotaxodon genus and the deep benthic group, compared with the mbuna group. The “SETS” file specifies which individuals belong to these groups. Finally, the command to execute the analysis is:

```bash
Dsuite Dinvestigate -w 50,25 scaffold_18.vcf.gz MalawiSetsFile.txt MalawiTestTriosForInvestigate.txt
```

The `-w 50,25` option specifies that the statistics should be averaged over windows of 50 informative SNPs, moving forward by 25 SNPs at each step. The run should take a little under 10 minutes. We suggest you have a tea/coffee break while you wait for the results ;).

**Question 10:**  What are the overall D and f_dM values over the entire scaffold_18? What does this suggest?

The results are output by Dsuite into the file `mbuna_deep_Diplotaxodon_localFstats__50_25.txt`. A little R plotting function [`plotInvestigateResults.R`](src/plotInvestigateResults.R) is prepared for you. Use the script to load in the file you just produced (line 3) and plot the D statistic (line 6).  Also execute line 8 of the script to plot the f_dM values. Do you see any signal near the opsin coordinates? We also plot the f_d statistic. As you can see, the top end of the plot is the same as for the f_dM, but the f_d is asymmetrical, extending far further into negative values. 

**Question 11:** Do you see any interesting signal in the D, f_dM, and f_d statistics? The opsin genes are located between 4.3Mb and 4.4Mb. Do you see anything interesting there?

<p align="center"><img src="data/Dinvestigate_bigWindow.png" alt="\*" width="600"></p>

You could also plot the new d_f statistic? Doe that look any better?

</details>

Finally, we zoom in at the region of the opsin genes (line 12). As you can see, the results look like a single “mountain” extending over 100kb.

</details>


But there is more structure than that in the region. Perhaps we need to reduce the window or step size to see a greater level of detail.

To save time, we prepared result files for runs with varying window and step sizes: [`mbuna_deep_Diplotaxodon_localFstats__50_5.txt`](data/mbuna_deep_Diplotaxodon_localFstats__50_5.txt),  [`mbuna_deep_Diplotaxodon_localFstats__50_1.txt`](data/mbuna_deep_Diplotaxodon_localFstats__50_1.txt),  [`mbuna_deep_Diplotaxodon_localFstats__10_1.txt`](data/mbuna_deep_Diplotaxodon_localFstats__10_1.txt), and  [`mbuna_deep_Diplotaxodon_localFstats__2_1.txt`](data/mbuna_deep_Diplotaxodon_localFstats__2_1.txt).

 They can be plotted with the same R script. Have a look at the results.
